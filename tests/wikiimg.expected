*Description:*
Read settings of joystick. If joystick position is outside DeadZone limits from the central position a movement with speed, defined by the joystick DeadZone edge to 100% deviation, begins. Joystick positions inside DeadZone limits correspond to zero speed (soft stop of motion) and positions beyond Low and High limits correspond MaxSpeed [i] or -MaxSpeed [i] (see command SCTL), where i = 0 by default and can be changed with left/right buttons (see command SCTL). This is illustrated on the following picture.

The relationship between the deviation and the rate is exponential, allowing no switching speed combine high mobility and accuracy. The following picture illustrates this:

The nonlinearity parameter is adjustable. Setting it to zero makes deviation/speed relation linear.
